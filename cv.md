## About myself  
The actual goal is to become a front end developer. During my studies I always liked the subjects we studied programming languages, but I never connected my life with this direction. 

My first work experience was working after college at the Integral plant.

I then worked for a manufacturing company as a sales manager. The company was just beginning to grow in the market, so I had the opportunity to participate in building its business processes. I developed the system of production planning, the system of raw material accounting, as well as the system of calculation of the cost of incoming raw materials. All of these systems were implemented on the basis of Google Tables.

I have successful experience in organizing my own business. The company designs and sells shelving equipment for warehouses. I have also independently developed the tools, based on Google Tables, which allow to track business profitability, expenses and profits on the projects. I also implemented the CRM system Bitrix24.

My strength is to find a solution for any situation.
